### Getting started with OpenStack

This talk will introduce OpenStack, from the viewpoint of a user. 
We will begin with a brief tour of [Horizon][horizon], the web interface for consuming OpenStack APIs, and continue through to using the command line tools.

The talk will also discuss the differences between a traditional 
virtual private server environment, and how the cloud model provides more
control and flexibility, as well as techniques that reduce the 
amount of "hands-on" time required to run day to day operations.
